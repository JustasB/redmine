		<h1>What?</h1>
		<p class="marketing-byline">
		<br/><strong>Open Source Brain</strong> is a resource for sharing and collaboratively developing computational models of neural systems. Open Source Brain facilitates development of computational neuronal models by providing facilities to analyse, visualise and share them. 
			<br/><br/>
			While the models can be collaboratively developed in any format, the ultimate goal is to help the computational community to share their models in <a href="http://www.neuroml.org">NeuroML</a>, a common standardised format which ensures transparency, modularity, accessibility and cross simulator portability.

		<h1>Why?</h1>
		<p class="marketing-byline">
			<br/>
			There are an increasing number of detailed single neuron and network models from various brain regions becoming available which encapsulate the latest data on anatomical and electrophysiological properties of the systems being investigated. These complex models take a long time to develop and are normally only available in one of many incompatible, simulator specific formats.

		<p class="marketing-byline">
			<br/>		
			Open Source Brain is currently developed by the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/silverlab/">Silver Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a> as part of a <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> funded project to encourage collaborative development of models in computational neuroscience.
			<br/>A number of research groups and organizations from all over the world are currently actively developing and sharing their neuronal models on OSB.</p>
